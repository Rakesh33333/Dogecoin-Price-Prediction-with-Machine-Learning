Predicting Dogecoin Price using Machine Learning...............
Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency, like Ethereum or Bitcoin — despite the fact that it’s totally different than both of these famous coins.
Dogecoin was initially made to some extent as a joke for crypto devotees and took its name from a previously well-known meme.
In this article, we will be implementing a machine learning model which can predict the pattern or forecast the price of the coin in the upcoming days.
I Built a Random Forest Regressor model to predict future price movements.
Evaluated model performance using RMSE and correlation metrics.
**Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn Scikit-Learn, Random Forest, Jupyter Notebook
